# Homework 1 - README

## 1. What problems did you finish?
- Problem 1: Compute Distance Matrix using nested for loop naive approach, and Vectorized Implementation approach
- Problem 2: Compute Correlation Matrix using nested for loop naive approach, and Vectorized Implementation approach
- Problem 3: Entropy Computation 

All problems were tested and verified with benchmark datasets (Iris, Breast Cancer, Digits).
